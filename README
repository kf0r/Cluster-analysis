# Cluster-Based Social Network Analysis for Review Graph
# Overview
Social network analysis project to find clusters of high modularity in graph representing reviews that are user-product relation.

Key Features:
-Extracting reviews from JSON dataset
-Projecting bipartiate graph to unipartiate weighted graph of reviews
-Clustering graph with Louvain, Leiden and Label Propagation algorithms
-Analysing and plotting statistics of clusters
-Saving clusters for further analysis
-Finding most important nodes in graph

# Requirements:
-Python 3.6 or higher
-networkx==3.3
-matplotlib==3.9.0
-numpy==2.0.0
-python-louvain==0.16
-leidenalg==0.10.2
-cdlib==0.4.0
-textblob==0.18.0.post0

These are included in the requirements.txt file. To install them, run 'pip install -r requirements.txt' in the terminal.
For generating documentation, you need to install sphinx using 'pip install sphinx.'
You also need datasets in JSON format in the data directory. You can get them here: https://nijianmo.github.io/amazon/index.html

# Installation
1. run 'pip install -r requirements.txt' in the terminal to install required packages.
2. run 'pip install sphinx' to install sphinx for generating documentation.
3. Download datasets in JSON format from https://nijianmo.github.io/amazon/index.html and put them in the data directory.
4. Run 'database.py' to build a database od metadata. Make sure that path to dataset is correct in your usage.
5. Run 'main.py' to start the program.
When running scripts you should be in the src directory to ensure that paths are correct.

# Dataflow:
If its first time runnim main.py, it will preprocess data and build a graph, that will be saved in the data directory.
If graph is already built, it will load it from the data directory. Make sure to remove review_graph.pkl from the data directory if you want to rebuild the graph.
Then, graph will be clustered using Louvain, Leiden and Label Propagation algorithms.
Clusters will be saved, analysed in terms of statistics and plotted.
Most important nodes in the graph will be found and saved.
